# Memory Cards Game:
A simple memory card game where the goal is to match all pairs with just five number of attempts.
This project was created to practise programming logic, DOM manipulation and basic game design.

# Languages and Tools used: 
- HTML, CSS: web layouts using CSS flex-box.
- JavaScript: Logic Programming and DOM manipulation.
- Visual Studio Code: Code Editor. 

# Instalation: 
- Clone this repository using the next command at git bush console: git clone https://github.com/LmartCid/Memory-Cards.git
- Open the project with VS Code: File/Open Folder to see the code in the editor.
- Run the main File: Open index.html file with a browser (Google Chrome).

  # How to Play: Basic guide:
  1-Start the game using start button. You also can change the theme of the game by using themes button in the main menu. 
  2- Click on two cards to flip them.
  3- If they match, they stay uncovered.
  4- If not, they flip back.
  5- if all pairs are found before you make 5 mistakes you win üéâ. Otherwise you loose ‚ùå.

# What I learned: 
- Array manipulation and shuffling algorithms
- Game state management (flipped cards, attempts...)
- DOM manipulation for interactive UI.
- Designing a clean and intuitive interface
- Application of clean code rules.
